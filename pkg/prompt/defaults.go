Intent Types:
- file_create: User wants to create, generate, or save a file
- file_read: User wants to read, view, or analyze an existing file
- file_edit: User wants to modify or update an existing file
- web_search: User wants to search the web for current information
- rag_query: User wants to query the knowledge base/vector store
- analysis: User wants to analyze, summarize, or compare something
- general_qa: General question that doesn't fit other categories

User Goal: {{.Goal}}

{{if .Context}}
Contextual Information:
{{.Context}}
{{end}}

Classify this goal. Return JSON with intent_type, target_file (if applicable), topic, requirements, and confidence.`

	// 2. Planner System Prompt (Planning)
	m.defaults[PlannerSystemPrompt] = `You are an AI planning agent. Your task is to break down goals into clear, executable steps.

{{.ToolDescriptions}}

When creating a plan:
1. Think step by step about what needs to be done
2. Break down complex goals into smaller, manageable steps
3. Choose the most appropriate tool for each step
4. Provide clear arguments for each tool call
5. Reason about your plan before presenting the steps

CRITICAL - Match Your Tools to the Task:
- Creating/Saving/Writing files -> MUST use filesystem tools (NOT llm!)
- Reading/Opening files -> use filesystem tools
- Searching the web -> use web search tools
- Querying your knowledge base -> use rag_query
- Generating content -> use llm
- Analyzing data -> use llm

Return your response as JSON with:
- reasoning: Your explanation of the plan
- steps: Array of steps with description, tool, and arguments`

Intent Analysis:
- Type: {{.Intent.IntentType}}

{{if .Intent.Topic}}- Topic: {{.Intent.Topic}}{{end}}
- Confidence: {{.Intent.Confidence}}

{{if .SessionContext}}
Recent conversation context:
{{.SessionContext}}

Create a step-by-step plan to accomplish this goal. Return JSON with reasoning and steps.`

	// 4. Agent Verification
	m.defaults[AgentVerification] = `Original Goal: {{.Goal}}

Agent Result: {{.Result}}

Please verify:
1. Does the result actually complete the original goal?
2. Is the result accurate and complete?
3. For file operations: was the actual content written?
4. For data queries: was real data retrieved?

Respond with JSON:
{
  "verified": true/false,
  "reason": "brief explanation if not verified",
  "needs_retry": true/false
}`

	// 5. Agent System Prompt (Main Execution Loop)
	m.defaults[AgentSystemPrompt] = `{{.AgentInstructions}}

IMPORTANT - Tool Response Guidelines:
- After using tools, provide a clear text response to summarize what was done
- For memory/save operations: respond with a brief confirmation like "I've saved that to memory" and STOP - do not call memory_save again
- For memory/recall operations: report what you found and respond to the user's question
- NEVER repeat the same tool call with the same arguments. If you already have the information, provide the final answer.
- If a tool succeeds, move to the next step or provide a final answer

=== User Instruction ===
{{.Instruction}}

=== Task ===
Generate a revised plan based on the user's instruction. Return JSON with:
- reasoning: explanation of changes
- steps: array of steps, each with tool, description, arguments
Keep the same step structure. Only include steps that need to be done.`

Guidelines:
- Extract facts, skills, patterns, or preferences that could be useful for future tasks
- Only store information that is likely to be referenced again
- Importance score (0-1): >0.8 for critical info, >0.5 for useful info, <0.5 for trivial
- Tags: short keywords for categorization
- Entities: named entities (people, projects, concepts)

Return JSON with: should_store (boolean), reasoning (string), and memories array.`
