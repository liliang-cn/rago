## Test Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Processor Core Tests (Priority: CRITICAL)
1. Complete existing service_test.go expansion
2. Add RAG pipeline integration tests
3. Add MCP integration tests with mocks
4. Add provider failover tests
5. Add concurrent operation tests

### Phase 2: API Handler Tests (Priority: HIGH)
1. Create handler test files for each handler
2. Test request/response validation
3. Test error handling and status codes
4. Test streaming endpoints
5. Test concurrent request handling

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. End-to-end RAG pipeline tests
2. API integration tests
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Load testing scenarios

## Validation Protocol

### After Each Test Implementation:
1. Run specific test file:
   ```bash
   go test ./pkg/processor -v
   go test ./api/handlers -v
   ```

2. Run with race detection:
   ```bash
   go test ./pkg/processor -race
   go test ./api/handlers -race
   ```

3. Check coverage:
   ```bash
   go test ./pkg/processor -cover
   go test ./api/handlers -cover
   ```

4. Ensure build succeeds:
   ```bash
   go build ./...
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All critical paths have test coverage
- [ ] No race conditions detected
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Coverage > 80% for critical packages
- [ ] Error scenarios properly tested
- [ ] Concurrent operations validated
- [ ] MCP fallback behavior tested

## Notes and Discoveries
- Existing processor tests need significant expansion
- MCP integration requires careful mocking
- Streaming endpoints need special test handling
- Provider switching logic is complex and needs thorough testing
